# Playground Project - iCE40 Stick Constraints
# Generic pin assignments for iCE40 FPGA stick development boards
# This file uses common pinout patterns for iCE40 sticks

# Clock input - typically 12MHz crystal on iCE40 boards
set_io clk 21

# LED outputs - common LED pins on iCE40 development boards
# Adjust these based on your specific board's pinout
set_io led[0] 95
set_io led[1] 96
set_io led[2] 97
set_io led[3] 98
set_io led[4] 99
set_io led[5] 101

# Note: These are generic pin assignments for iCE40 sticks
# You may need to adjust them based on your specific board's pinout
# Common iCE40 boards like iCEstick use different pin numbers
# Check your board's documentation for exact pin assignments
