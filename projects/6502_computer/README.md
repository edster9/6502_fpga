    â”œâ”€â”€ build.sh   # Assembly build script
    â””â”€â”€ hello_manual.txt  # Manual assembly reference
```

## Building the Hardware

From the project root directory:

```bash
# Simulate the CPU
make sim-6502_computer

# Build for Tang Nano 9K  
make 6502_computer

# Program to FPGA
make prog-6502_computer

# View simulation waveforms
make wave-6502_computer
```

## Assembly Programming

The `asm/` directory contains 6502 assembly programs that can run on the CPU.

### Requirements
- cc65 toolchain (assembler and linker)
- Install from: https://github.com/cc65/cc65/releases/latest

### Building Assembly Programs
```bash
cd projects/6502_computer/asm
./build.sh hello
```

## Current Status

âœ… **CPU Core**: Arlet Ottens 6502 - fully verified  
âœ… **Simulation**: Comprehensive testbench with real 6502 program  
âœ… **FPGA Build**: Successfully synthesizes and routes  
âœ… **Assembly Tools**: Basic setup with cc65 configuration  
ðŸ”„ **Memory System**: Currently just NOP stub  
ðŸ”„ **I/O System**: Not yet implemented  

## Test Results

The CPU has been verified to correctly execute:
- Load immediate (LDA, LDX, LDY)
- Store operations (STA, STX, STY)  
- Memory loads (LDA from memory)
- Arithmetic (ADC with carry handling)
- Increment/Decrement (INX, INY, DEX)
- Control flow (JMP instructions)

All tests pass with 100% success rate!
