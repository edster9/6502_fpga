# Lattice Diamond Programmer Integration Summary

## Problem Statement
After successfully resolving FTDI driver conflicts for iceprog functionality, attempted to integrate Lattice Diamond Programmer with the Go Board iCE40HX1K development setup. Goal was to enable both OSS CAD Suite (iceprog) and Lattice Diamond programming tools to work with the same hardware.

## Initial Setup & Hardware Detection
- **Board**: Go Board with iCE40HX1K FPGA + Micron M25P10 flash
- **FTDI Interface**: FT2232HL dual-channel USB-to-serial converter
- **Flash Chip**: Micron M25P10 (1 Mbit SPI Serial Flash, ID: 0x20 0x20 0x11 0x00)

## Driver Compatibility Investigation

### Initial State (WinUSB Drivers)
- iceprog working perfectly with WinUSB drivers (set via Zadig)
- Diamond Programmer detecting FTDI cable but failing SPI communication
- **Cable Detection**: ✅ "Detected HW-USBN-2B (FTDI) cable at port FTUSB-0"
- **Programming Error**: ❌ "Data Expected: h10 Actual: hFF" - unable to read flash device ID

### Driver Interface Conflict Analysis
**Root Cause**: Different driver interface requirements
- **iceprog**: Requires WinUSB drivers for direct FTDI MPSSE access
- **Diamond**: Requires VCP (Virtual COM Port) or libusbK drivers for serial communication
- **Conflict**: Cannot use both driver types simultaneously on same FTDI interface

### Driver Resolution
**Solution**: Restored original FTDI drivers (libusbK)
- Uninstalled WinUSB drivers set by Zadig
- Reinstalled original FTDI drivers from Lattice Diamond installation
- **Result**: Diamond programming functionality restored
- **Trade-off**: iceprog functionality temporarily disabled

## Programming Mode Evaluation

### SPI Flash Programming ✅
**Configuration**:
- Access mode: SPI Flash Programming
- Family: SPI Serial Flash
- Vendor: Micron
- Device: M25P10
- Package: 8-pin SOIC
- Cable: HW-USBN-2B (FTDI)

**Results**: Successfully programmed test_led2_only.bin to flash
- Flash erase, program, and verify operations completed
- FPGA automatically loaded new configuration from flash
- Hardware validation: LED2 illuminated as expected

### CRAM Programming ❌
**Attempted Configuration**:
- Access mode: CRAM Programming  
- Operation: Fast Program
- File: test_led2_only.bin

**Failure Analysis**:
```
ERROR - Programming failed.
"Device detection failed. Cannot continue."
```

**Root Cause**: Go Board hardware limitation
- No direct FTDI-to-FPGA connection for SRAM programming
- iCE40HX1K JTAG pins not connected on Go Board
- Hardware designed exclusively for SPI flash-based configuration

## Hardware Architecture Understanding

### Go Board Signal Path
```
USB → FTDI FT2232HL → SPI Interface → M25P10 Flash → iCE40 FPGA
```

**Programming Methods Available**:
- ✅ **SPI Flash Programming**: FTDI → Flash → FPGA (on boot)
- ❌ **Direct SRAM Programming**: Requires FTDI → FPGA (not connected)
- ❌ **JTAG Programming**: Requires JTAG pins (not available)

### Design Implications
- Go Board optimized for flash-based development workflow
- Configuration persistence through power cycles
- No support for volatile SRAM-only programming
- Simpler hardware design, lower cost, fewer signal routing requirements

## Development Workflow Solutions

### Option 1: Tool-Specific Driver Switching
**Pros**: Both tools functional when needed
**Cons**: Manual driver switching required
**Implementation**: 
- Use Zadig to switch FTDI drivers between WinUSB (iceprog) and libusbK (Diamond)
- Workflow overhead for driver management

### Option 2: Hybrid Development Approach ⭐ **Recommended**
**Design Phase**: Lattice Diamond + Synplify Pro
- Professional design entry and synthesis tools
- Advanced optimization and timing analysis
- Industry-standard FPGA development environment

**Programming Phase**: OSS CAD Suite (iceprog)
- Reliable, fast programming through command line
- Consistent driver compatibility
- Scriptable for automated workflows

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Diamond: Design → Synthesize → Export bitstream
# OSS CAD Suite: Program exported bitstream
iceprog design_output.bin
```

### Option 3: Diamond-Only Workflow
**Pros**: Single-tool consistency, professional development environment
**Cons**: Requires permanent driver configuration, potential future iceprog conflicts
**Best for**: Production development with Diamond-centric toolchain

## Technical Lessons Learned

### FTDI Driver Architecture
- **WinUSB**: Direct hardware access, required for MPSSE mode (iceprog)
- **VCP**: Creates COM ports, required for serial communication (Diamond)  
- **libusbK**: Alternative direct access, compatible with Diamond
- **Zadig Tool**: Can switch between driver types but affects all applications

### Flash Programming vs SRAM Programming
- **Flash Programming**: Persistent, requires erase cycles, FPGA loads on boot
- **SRAM Programming**: Volatile, immediate execution, requires direct FPGA access
- **Go Board Design**: Flash-only architecture, no direct FPGA programming capability

### Hardware Design Trade-offs
- **Simplified Design**: Fewer pins, lower cost, easier routing
- **Programming Limitation**: SPI flash only, no SRAM programming
- **Development Impact**: Slightly slower iteration (flash write cycles) but persistent configuration

## Final Recommendations

### For Active Development
1. **Use Diamond for design and synthesis** - Professional tools, better optimization
2. **Export bitstreams from Diamond** - Generate .bin files for programming  
3. **Switch to WinUSB drivers** - Enable iceprog for reliable programming
4. **Program with iceprog** - Fast, reliable, command-line scriptable

### For Production Workflows
1. **Standardize on Diamond toolchain** - Keep libusbK drivers permanent
2. **Use Diamond SPI flash programming** - Single-tool workflow consistency
3. **Accept flash programming model** - Design workflow around persistent configuration

### Key Success Factors
- **Driver Management**: Understand FTDI driver requirements for each tool
- **Hardware Limitations**: Accept Go Board's flash-only programming model  
- **Workflow Optimization**: Choose tool combination that matches development style
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear procedures for driver switching if needed

**Final Status**: ✅ Both Diamond and iceprog programming methods validated and functional with appropriate driver configurations.
